## 📢 News
- **[2026.01]** 🎉 DualMind has been accepted by **The Web Conference (WWW) 2026 (Demo Track)**!
- **[2026.01]** We are preparing the code and demo data.

## 🚧 Code & Data Release
This repository will host the official implementation of **DualMind**, including:
1. The **Multi-Agent Simulation Backend** (FastAPI + LangChain).
2. The **Interactive Frontend** (React + Ant Design).
3. The **Curated Dataset** of 15 real-world PR crises (post-Aug 2024).

> **The source code is scheduled to be released before February 20, 2026.** > Please star 🌟 this repo to stay tuned!

## 🖼️ System Overview
DualMind is an LLM-driven multi-agent simulation platform that models the interplay between rapidly fluctuating emotions and the slower evolution of cognitive states.

## 📝 Abstract
The diffusion of public opinion during PR crises is highly volatile and remains difficult to forecast. Existing simulation frameworks typically overlook the complex interaction between transient affective responses and persistent cognitive beliefs. To address this limitation, we present **DualMind**, a new LLM-driven multi-agent simulation platform... [Content from your abstract]
